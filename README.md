This repo has my vim and zsh configuration:
- The ```.vim``` directory has a ```vimrc``` file, just creating a soft link to this repo's ```.vim``` file in your home directory would make it work.
- There is a ```.zshrc``` file which you can create a symlink for in your home directory.
- The ```git_template``` directory has the hooks for ctags, i.e. post_commit, post_checkout etc. You can create a symlink in your home directory to this directory.
